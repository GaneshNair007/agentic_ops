"""Frozen interface contract between orchestrator/ (llm side) and rag/ + tools/ (partner side).

These four signatures must never change without both partners agreeing first.
This module is the stable facade: callers may import retrieve/remember/
execute_action/emit_event from here and stay decoupled from where the real
implementations live.

Retrieval routes to rag/retrieve.py (ChromaDB semantic search) with an
automatic fallback to rag/store.py (keyword overlap) when the vector DB is
unavailable. Results are normalised to always expose both 'kind' and
'document_type' so legacy consumers (orchestrator) and new consumers (app.py)
both work without changes.

Events route to tools/event_bus.py (thread-safe, persistent JSONL timeline).

Implementations are imported lazily so this file imports cleanly in any
checkout; a missing module surfaces as an ImportError only when called.
